I added some options for registration. first I added some code for online checking username and email (ajax checking) it works before submitting registration form. and the second one, I added action cycle to send user an activation code(random and 1 minute life time) by email.
I also worked on front-end part too, I changed some part of front-end code (javascript and html) and changed the model on back-end (MVC) of interaction with front-end.
Now you can add new events byTanna html codes.(monthly view)
